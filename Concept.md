The internship that I did this summer helped prepare me for this project because I used a lot of JvaScript while I was there and I am grateful for UPS.
Concept Proposal
We want you to take some of the feedback you received from the brainstorming session to flesh out your project and give a more formal proposal. We understand that at this point, some of what you write will be guesses, so this is a living document that may change over time. Create a file called concept.md in your repository and include details in the following sections:

### J-Elegance.com
Having a website where people can freely shop for trendy wear and African wears
Shopping -My Novelty is to share my sense of fashion with the world and have the world see fashion through my lenses
Customers will be able to buy and the website will be able to charge every customer and deliver to the customer's address
My audience will be the public, Bereans, and Berea faculty and staff
This project is huge and I know I will have challenges adding the cart to the website, adding the banking system that takes out money from customers when they buy, and also delivering to their address. Also, I would like to add a tracking system of packages to the website which I feel is going to be challenging. I would also like those who buy from my store to have the ability to return the things that have not met their expectations.
Measures
My motivation is my sense of fashion. I love to look good and I like trying on new dressing ideas.
For the future, I would like this website to be fully functional and something that I can use as a side hustle.

### Context: 
I am a lover of fashion and I come from a country that has a very rich culture and a high sense of Fashion. I noticed that people always appreciate what I wear. Most times, it is not necessarily expensive  clothing but it is just how I complement the things that I wear. J-Elegance.com is a way for me to share my sense of fashion with the world.
### Novelty: 
The novelty is just to let people see fashion through my lenses. Why I wear what I wear, and the reason behind what I wear. I want to create a brand that is accessible to everyone in any age group and sex. 

### Functionality: 
I want people to see the riches of my culture through fashion and give everyone who is interested a taste of my culture. I would also like to help people incorporate new dressing styles that they might have never thought possible into their daily lifestyles

### Audience: 
J-Elgance is meant to dress everyone from any age group. 

### Challenges: 
This project is huge and I know I will have challenges adding the cart to the website, adding the banking system that takes out money from customers when they buy, and also delivering to their address. Also, I would like to add a tracking system of packages to the website which I feel is going to be challenging. I would also like those who buy from my store to have the ability to return the things that have not met their expectations.

### Measures: 
I want this website to be a fully functional website. I want it to have the ability to function like just any e-commerce website that you can think of. As a result, I will measure the progress as I build. If I succeed in getting the cart onto the website, that will be a milestone. If I put in listings that will be another. I will measure my progress as I go. 

### Motivation: 
Fashion is my primary motivation and if I get this working properly, it may serve as a side hustle.
### Future Extensions: 
To develop it into a fully functional website like Etsy or Amazon.
