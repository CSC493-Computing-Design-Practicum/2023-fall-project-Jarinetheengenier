The internship that I did this summer helped prepare me for this project because I used a lot of JvaScript while I was there and I am grateful for UPS.
Concept Proposal
We want you to take some of the feedback you received from the brainstorming session to flesh out your project and give a more formal proposal. We understand that at this point, some of what you write will be guesses, so this is a living document that may change over time. Create a file called concept.md in your repository and include details in the following sections:

### J-Elegance.com
Having a website where people can freely shop for trendy wear and African wears
Shopping -My Novelty is to share my sense of fashion with the world and have the world see fashion through my lenses
Customers will be able to buy and the website will be able to charge every customer and deliver to the customer's address
My audience will be the public, Bereans, and Berea faculty and staff
This project is huge and I know I will have challenges adding the cart to the website, adding the banking system that takes out money from customers when they buy, and also delivering to their address. Also, I would like to add a tracking system of packages to the website which I feel is going to be challenging. I would also like those who buy from my store to have the ability to return the things that have not met their expectations.
Measures
My motivation is my sense of fashion. I love to look good and I like trying on new dressing ideas.
For the future, I would like this website to be fully functional and something that I can use as a side hustle.
