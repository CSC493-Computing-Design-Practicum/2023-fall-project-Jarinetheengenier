## CSC 493: R03: Update Requirements and Software Development1


Documentation
You have two written tasks to complete before next time. First, update the README.md file with any changes you have made in your project. and include links to your concept and requirements files. To add the links, encapsulate the text to be seen with square brackets and then immediately follow that with parenthesis with RELATIVE links that consist of just the filename.

## README.md

Project name
Project Concept (linked to concept.md)
Vision
Remember that the paragraph of your vision is here.
Scope

Prerequisites
Requirements (linked to requirements.md)

Secondly, you are to finalize the Software Requirements Specifications (SRS) in requirements.md. This step includes breaking down still complex components into individual doable pieces and then prioritizing the list to put the most important core components at the top.

## requirements.md

Number: (List unique requirement number.)
Statement: (Precisely state the requirement.)
Evaluation Method: (How can you tell if the completed software satisfies this requirement?)
Dependency: (List each other requirement on which satisfaction of this requirement depends or write "None")
Priority: (Assign a priority to this requirement: essential, high, middle, low, or if time permits.)
Requirement revision history: (when, what, and why)
You may want to use MarkDown cheat sheet and MarkDown Live Demo.

Begin Software development
Once you determine the CORE requirements of your system, you can start seriously thinking about HOW you want to implement them. There is no length requirement for how much software you write before next time.

## To Submit
Commit changes to your repository and be ready to bring them up in the reporting out session.

Remember to begin implementing the core components of your system for a "proof of concept" prototype!
