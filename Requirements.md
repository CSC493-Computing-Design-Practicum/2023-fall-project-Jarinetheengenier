## CSC 493: R03: Update Requirements and Software Development1


Documentation
You have two written tasks to complete before next time. First, update the README.md file with any changes you have made in your project. and include links to your concept and requirements files. To add the links, encapsulate the text to be seen with square brackets and then immediately follow that with parenthesis with RELATIVE links that consist of just the filename.

Secondly, you are to finalize the Software Requirements Specifications (SRS) in requirements.md. This step includes breaking down still complex components into individual doable pieces and then prioritizing the list to put the most important core components at the top.

## requirements.md

## Number: 1

Statement: Getting started with the homepage

Evaluation Method: I Plan to write down code in Visual Studio code and then use Bootstrap to design the home page of the website. I will be able to tell if the software I have used has worked if I successfully get the logo into the website, if the homepage tab is there and working, and if I have successfully added the cart

Dependency: None

Priority: High Importance

Requirement revision history: I have to revise my Knowledge of JavaScript and the frameworks. This will help me in my thought process and also keep me updated with the new things that JavaScript can do.


## Number: 2

Statement: Adding Cart, Logo, and navigation taps on the homepage

Evaluation Method: I will know I have completed the work when I have successfully added the logo, cart, and navigation taps that can take me to different pages of the website. 

Dependency: This requirement is dependent on requirement 1

Priority: High Importance

Requirement revision history: Learn how to make Logos'.

## Number: 3

Statement: Adding multiple pages to the website. This includes the "About Us" page, Help page, Explore page

Evaluation Method: I am using JavaScript and with CSS or Bootstrap frameworks, I should be able to add and design the pages.

Dependency: This requirement depends on requirement 2

Priority: Medium Importance

Requirement revision history: I will watch some YouTube tutorials that will help me add the pages to the website.

## Number:4

Statement: Add listings to the website

Evaluation Method: Add different listings to the website and make it ser efficient

Dependency: Dependent on requirements 2 and 3

Priority: This requirement is of high importance because I won't have a project if this step is not done.

Requirement revision history: I do not need any revision for this requirement

## Number: 5

Statement: Start developing the back end

Evaluation Method: I will use Django to develop the back end of this project.

Dependency: Dependent on the first 4 requirements

Priority: Very High Importance

Requirement revision history: A detailed study of Django is required because I have never used it before.

## Number: 6

Statement: Add payment Options

Evaluation Method: Profesor Deanna suggested that I use the PayPal payment option so that credit cards can be easily processed. 

I have never done this before but, that is why I am in this class. I will learn how it is done.

Dependency: None

Priority: High Importance. The payment option needs to be there for this website to be considered complete.

Requirement revision history: I will look at YouTube tutorials on how to use Django and also do research on how to add a payment option to my website.


## Number: (List unique requirement number.)

Statement: (Precisely state the requirement.)

Evaluation Method: (How can you tell if the completed software satisfies this requirement?)

Dependency: (List each other requirement on which satisfaction of this requirement depends or write "None")

Priority: (Assign a priority to this requirement: essential, high, middle, low, or if time permits.)

Requirement revision history: (when, what, and why)


Begin Software development
Once you determine the CORE requirements of your system, you can start seriously thinking about HOW you want to implement them. There is no length requirement for how much software you write before next time.

## To Submit
Commit changes to your repository and be ready to bring them up in the reporting out session.

Remember to begin implementing the core components of your system for a "proof of concept" prototype!
