## CSC493: R04: Software Design<sup>1</sup>

## Overview
You have created the <code>requirements.md</code> file that should have started to outline the requirements for your project.

This weekâ€™s new work will move from the planning and analysis phase to beginning to the design phase of the software project.

It is well understood by strong software developers that the functional elements of a program should not
ever be allowed to become too large. If any component of a program grows beyond the size where it's
readily comprehensible as a unit, it can too easily conceal errors. Thus, any software with large
components is likely to be harder to read, harder to test, and harder to debug. The design process
clarifies exactly how the developer plans to implement the design specifications, i.e. how the software is
to be written, and with which small components. In particular, the main work of this first part of the
design phase is to present an architectural model of the software components.

## Documentation

You have some tasks to complete before next time:
- Complete the Preliminary Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document that you have been working for a while now.
- Create and complete a file called <code>design.md</code>.
- Update <code>README.md</code> to link to the file you just created.
