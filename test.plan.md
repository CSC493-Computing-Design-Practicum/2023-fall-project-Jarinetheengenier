# CSC 493: R09: Testing Plan<sup>1</sup>

## Overview
From the prototype of the J-elegance that was built, I will be making some test cases for the web applications to make sure that it works appropriately on the Figma as it would on the actual website.

## Documentation

I will have a few test cases for my project.
- Testing if the functionality is good
- Checking for good responsiveness when I hover over pictures
- Testing if the shop no button on the homepage works
- Checking if the Add to Cart button on the listings work
- Test if the different pages work
- Testing if I can see all the things I have added to my cart
- Test if I am able to add my payment details
- Check if the user can check out securely
