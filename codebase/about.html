        <h1>J-Elegance is a fashion brand that is inspired by cultural
            difference. Travelling from cameroon to the United States opened me up to the western Culture.
            I have embraced the culture but that does not mean that I have forgotten about my own culture.
            J-Elegance is meant and designed to showcase my culture in style and have the world see fashion through my lenses.
